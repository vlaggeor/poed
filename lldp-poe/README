# Port state machine and LLDP neighbor updates processing daemon - `lldp-poed`

This agent is capable of holding each individual `swp` state for further
dispatching commands to `poed` for setting the port power limit and
querying dot3 port details. To better understand the flow transitions
from `port_state_machine.c`, please refer to the following state machine diagram:

The LLDP neighbor updates are send/received using `liblldpctl` in the `lldp_event_handler.c`.
Incoming updates are sent to the state machine to be processed further.
